# Visualizing WhatsApp chats via JavaScript

## Demo
https://danielbiegler.github.io/visualize-whatsapp-chats/

## Why
I was looking for a visualizer and found some incomplete small examples or sites who you have to send your chat to. *(Wtf, are you insane?)* 

I'm not gonna send a random site on the web my chatlogs, no thank you sir.

Found some visualizers that create small pictures, but I want interactivity, I want to be able to zoom in for example.

So I created this to be able to visualize interactive graphs which are generated **offline(!)**.
